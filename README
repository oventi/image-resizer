image-resizer

image-resizer is a javascript library that resizes images on the client side.

the idea with this code was an experimentation with the canvas element and file reader of HTML5.

* Example

// file: object of type File
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File

var ir = new ImageResizer(file, {r: 0.5, w: 300});
ir.resize(function (data_url) {
    // data_url is the data URI of the resized image
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/data_URIs
});
