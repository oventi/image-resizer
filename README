image-resizer

image-resizer is a javascript library that resizes images on the client side, 
and optionally saves them on the server.

the idea with this code was an experimentation with the canvas element and file reader of HTML5

there are two objects: Resizer and Resized

Resizer: resizes an image
    methods 
        resize(file, resize_factor, resize_done);
            file: file: object of type File, http://mzl.la/1nFeQFb
            resize_factor: a number greater than 0
                if > 1, file will be resized to a fixed width
                if < 1, file will be resized by percentage
            resize_done: callback function after the resize is done
                that function will be sent a parameter of type Resized

Resized: the resized image provided by Resizer
    attributes
        save_path: the folder to save the images, by default is the current folder
        
        post_url: the file or path to do the http post, by default is the included image-resizer.php
        
    methods
        get_url: gets the data url of the resized image

        save(save_done): saves the image
            save_done: callback function after the save is done
                that function will receive an object with these properties:
                    ok: boolean, if the saving went ok
                    file_name: the name of the saved file
