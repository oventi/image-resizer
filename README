image-resizer

image-resizer is a javascript library that resizes images on the client side, 
and optional server side image saving.

the idea with this code was an experimentation with the canvas element and file reader of HTML5

* Example

// file: object of type File
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File

/* 
 * if the number > 1, it is used as fixed width
 * if the number < 1, it is used as percentage
 */
var ir = new ImageResizer(file, 640); 

// resize on the client side, return the data URL
ir.resize(function (data_url) {
    // data_url is the data URI of the resized image
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/data_URIs
});

// resize on the client side, post and save the resized image
// a folder named result should be on the same directory as the script
ir.resize_save(function (ok) {
    // ok is binary, it tells you if the resize and save was done
});
